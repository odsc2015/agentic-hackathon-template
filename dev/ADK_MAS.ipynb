        "Why build one agent that does everything when you can build a **team of specialist agents?** The **Agent-as-a-Tool** pattern allows one agent to delegate a task to another agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Concept:** This is different from a sub-agent. When Agent A calls Agent B as a tool, Agent B's response is passed **back to Agent A**. Agent A then uses that information to form its own final response to the user. It's a powerful way to compose complex behaviors from simpler, focused, and reusable agents."

        "Our top-level agent, the `trip_data_concierge_agent`, acts as the **Orchestrator**. It has two tools at its disposal:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  `call_db_agent`: A function that internally calls our `db_agent` to fetch raw data.\n",
        "2.  `call_concierge_agent`: A function that calls the `concierge_agent`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `concierge_agent` itself has a tool: the `food_critic_agent`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The flow for a complex query is:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **User** asks the `trip_data_concierge_agent` for a hotel and a nearby restaurant.\n",
        "2.  The **Orchestrator** first calls `call_db_agent` to get hotel data.\n",
        "3.  The data is saved in `tool_context.state`.\n",
        "4.  The **Orchestrator** then calls `call_concierge_agent`, which retrieves the hotel data from the context.\n",
        "5.  The `concierge_agent` receives the request and decides it needs to use its own tool, the `food_critic_agent`.\n",
        "6.  The `food_critic_agent` provides a witty recommendation.\n",
        "7.  The `concierge_agent` gets the critic's response and politely formats it.\n",
        "8.  This final, polished response is returned to the **Orchestrator**, which presents it to the user."
